# Console Finances

## User Story
 
You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate the relevant profits and losses. 

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text

  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
